You can find the description of every portfolio piece at the beginning of the portfolio. The pieces are mainly about different ways to analyze my first year projects, but they also include some random pieces where I tried to solve other problems I encountered before. Some pieces are done and others I may revisit in the future to refine or build on. 

Thank you Mason so much for a wonderful semester! I appreciate the flexibility of the course and I learned so much from it. I'm able to so many more things now that I wanted to do but didn't have the skills to do back then.

I hope you enjoy the portfolio!

# Readme

This template is optional, but it is one potential way to help you organize your portfolio pieces. 

## Getting Started

1. Click on the "Use this template" button, which is typically located above the list of files.

2. GitHub will prompt you to create a new repository based on the template. Enter a name for your repository and provide a short description if desired.

3. Choose the visibility for your repository. If you want it to be publicly accessible, select the "Public" option. If you prefer to keep it private, choose the "Private" option (note that private repositories require a paid GitHub subscription).

4. After selecting the desired visibility, click on the "Create repository from template" button.

5. GitHub will create a new repository for you, based on the template you chose. You will be automatically redirected to the repository's page.

6. In the repository, you should see the files and folders that make up the portfolio template.

7. The template includes a "docs" folder with the page source. So you'll need to configure GitHub Pages to use it. Click on the "Settings" tab located on the right-hand side of the repository's navigation bar.

8. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.

9. Under "Source," you should see a dropdown menu. Select the "main" branch if it's not already selected.

10. Next to the branch selection, there is a dropdown menu labeled "None." Click on it and choose the "main" branch again.

11. A new dropdown option will appear. Select the "docs" folder from the list.

12. After selecting the "docs" folder, click on the "Save" button. GitHub will build and deploy the webpage using the portfolio template.

13. Once the webpage is deployed, you will see a green message indicating the URL where your portfolio can be accessed. It might take a few moments for the page to be ready.

14. You can now visit the provided URL to view your portfolio.

That's it! You have successfully activated the portfolio template using GitHub. Customize the template and add your own portfolio pieces! üòÅ
